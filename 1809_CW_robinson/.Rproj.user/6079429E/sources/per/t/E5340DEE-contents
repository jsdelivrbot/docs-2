Fully shared project between Robrecht Cannoodt and me

## `r medium_picture("dyno1.png")`

```r

  dataset, 
  c("paga", "slingshot", "monocle_ddrtree", "raceid_stemid", "scuba", "pcreode")
)
map(models$model, dynplot::plot_dimred) %>% patchwork::wrap_plots()

# The goal of...

## Komparo
- Esperanto for "compare"
- Esperanto is meant to democratise language, it fits!
- Also *happens* to be the only decent organisation name available on github

## The goal of komparo

## Requirements

Summarised in a few buzz words

> - Modular, *one-click extendable*
> - Reproducible, *one-click and it runs!*
> - Democratic, *decentralised*
> - Testable, *assure it works and stays working*
> - Continuously integrated, *no-click testing*
> - Deployable to users, *one-click run*

## Previous work

Several projects with protein/RNA structure prediction, such as **CompaRNA**

- Modular ✘
- Reproducible ✘
- Democratic ✘
- Testable ✘
- Continuously integrated ✘
- Deployable to users ✘

## Previous work

**Dynamic Statistical Comparisons** - a "workflow" management system for comparisons

**SummarizedBenchmark**

- Modular ✔️
- Reproducible ✔️
- Democratic ±
- Testable ✘
- Continuously integrated ✘
- Deployable to users ✘

## Proposed pipeline

![pipeline](img/pipeline.svg)

## First test: Differential expression in trajectories

- Several methods already available
- Simulator is ready
- Off-the-shelf metrics
- Highly useful for users
  
## Second test: Trajectory synchronisation
  
- Several methods already available
- Simulator can be adapted
- Some custom metrics
- Highly useful for users

## But first...

finish the trajectory benchmark! Almost there!
